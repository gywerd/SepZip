Translated system's context menu for PeaZip, works for cascaded context menu entries on W7 or more recent systems.

HOW TO APPLY TRANSLATION TO CONTEXT MENU:
From PeaZip 6.9.2 release, changing language in application also apply corresponding translation to context menu entries, if suitable .reg file is found.
To manually change context menu translation, doubleclick the .reg file (Windows registry script) for the desired language and confirm merging the entries in the registry.

HOW TO CONTRIBUTE A NEW TRANSLATION OR MAINTAIN AN EXISTING ONE:

Option 1)
With a plain text editor, translate the quoted texts after the @= sign.
Save the file as ANSI text, or Unicode if extended characters are featured (UTF8 encoding is not currently supported by Windows .reg scripts) - the text editor software should prompt a message if this condition is applicable, or an encoding selection control should be featured in "Save as" dialog for most editors.
You can send the translated script to giorgio.tani.software@gmail.com to share the translation with the community under LGPL license.
